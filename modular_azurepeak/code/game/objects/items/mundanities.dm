//impossible. before you look at this and screech - even the highest int bonus jobs in the game start with a 0% chance assuming worst roll from this to beat this thing
//the only job that can 'consistently' crack this is archivist, who starts with a 30% chance, assuming worst roll from this. but then ur stuck playing archivist so ??? stat-packs help, but you'll still end up worse off tbh
