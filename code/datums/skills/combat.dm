		"...A barkeep whistles as he cleans glasses and a drunkard snores, passed out on the counter. The rest of the tavern is focussed on you with bated breath as your dagger darts between your fingers in an impressive display of legerdemain...",
		"...a flash of steel through the sky, and another, and another. Blades pass between your juggling hands as if you were pulling on singular, thick rope...",
		"...you tuck the blade away in your cloak, and offer yourself up for inspection. While small, the invisible blade cannot be parried..."

	dreams = list(
		"...your heart beats wildly as your swords clash, you parry your opponent and finish him off with a decisive slash...",
		"...a shining length of ivory steel. A token. A symbol. More than just a weapon. Blood runs thick in the wash-bin. Sparks fly from the grinding stone. You maintain the blade, and it maintains your honour..."

	"...'I am ineffable. I am unpiercable.' The wicked white gaurdian says. And so, you shatter its skull with your mace, for it was not unbludgeonable...",
	"...The air shakes and buckles under the ever incessant ringing from your harmonic bell toll of death. This is your symphony. Revel in its beauty, and simplicity...",
	"...'This blade is a masterwork of Malum's craftsmanship.' Said the elf, before his head underwent the sudden transformation from brain to pavement decor under the sheer mass of your primordial tool..."

	"...stuck in the flesh, you rip away at your weapon. It comes loose. Blood splatters across your armor and cloak and the side of your face. Hunting is no easy job, but the old man's teachings are effective...",
	"...your axe comes down, and another tree falls. Sap runs down your face. You are cutting through the forest until it is a thicket, and through the thicket until it is a plains. Only when you look down do you see the cracked bones, the cut flesh, and the mangled faces. The town square has turned crimson...",
	"...The heft of Iron pulls upon your arm. It knows where it wishes to be, all you have to do is guide its fall. Knowing this, your axe feels lighter than you remember...",
